# NLP-Based Cancer Type Classification Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where four different machine learning models - Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network - are applied to an NLP problem. The project focuses on classifying types of cancer based on the content of scientific papers discussing them. Advanced techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other visualization methods are employed to analyze the models' performance.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project comprises scientific papers related to various types of cancer. Key features of the dataset include:

- **Paper Content**: Text data extracted from scientific papers.
- **Cancer Type**: Labels indicating the type of cancer discussed in each paper.

## Methodology

The project encompasses several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using NLP techniques to extract features from text data.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing Gaussian NB, KNN, SVM, and Neural Network models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing each model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying PCA for visualization and analysis of the models' performance.
